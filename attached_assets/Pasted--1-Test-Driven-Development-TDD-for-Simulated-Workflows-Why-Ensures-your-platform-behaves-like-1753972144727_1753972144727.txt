🔍 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD) for Simulated Workflows

Why: Ensures your platform behaves like a real-world data science environment.
Actionables:

    Write unit tests for simulation logic (project creation, dataset linking, achievement unlocking).

    Use Jest + Supertest if you're on Node.js/Express.

    Add test coverage badges to your GitHub README.

📁 2. Real-World Project Templates (High Priority)

Why: Students crave hands-on, contextual experience. Templates add massive value.
Ideas to seed:

    Customer Churn Prediction (classification)

    IPL Match Outcome Predictor (multivariate regression)

    Credit Card Fraud Detection (imbalanced classification)

    EDA Report Generator (auto markdown + visualization)

    Preload these as templates users can fork and edit.

Add tags like:

{ difficulty: 'Intermediate', tools: ['pandas', 'matplotlib', 'scikit-learn'], domain: 'Finance' }

🧠 3. Mentor Mode + AI Hints Overlay

Why: Makes your AI Mentor feel proactive and not just reactive.
Ideas:

    Contextual hints: e.g., “You imported pandas but haven't loaded your dataset yet.”

    Use chat_history + project state to guide interventions.

🎮 4. Gamification Layer (Progress Tracker + Rewards)

Why: Keeps users addicted (in a healthy way).
Suggestions:

    Weekly challenges + XP leaderboard.

    Dynamic badge system based on database events (e.g., trained 5 models = “Model Maniac” badge).

    Use progress rings, streak counters, and emojis 🎯

🛠 5. Admin Dashboard & Analytics

Why: To understand your users and iterate fast.
Build:

    Track active users, project count, completion rate, session duration.

    Top-performing projects/datasets (for insight into what's working).

    Use PostgreSQL views or materialized views for these metrics.

📦 6. Dataset Explorer + Integration (with OpenML or Kaggle)

Why: Real datasets unlock real value.
Features:

    Searchable dataset browser.

    Quick preview (rows, columns, nulls, types).

    One-click import into user project.

🔐 7. User Profiles with Project Showcases

Why: Users want to show off their simulated journey.
Add:

    Public profile links: dataprosimx.com/user/karthik

    Sections: Completed Projects, Achievements, Skill Badges

✨ Bonus Ideas (for later stages)

    Collab Mode: Invite friends to work on a project live (like Google Docs).

    Code Versioning: Lightweight Git-like history for projects.

    Notebook Mode: Jupyter-style markdown/code combo (inspired by Observable or Deepnote).
